# â˜• java_practice

This folder contains my Java implementations and problem-solving practice for both DSA and Competitive Programming.  
My current prep is based on the following two books:

- ðŸ“˜ _Grokking Algorithms_ â€“ for clear DSA concepts and visual understanding
- ðŸ“— _Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (4th Edition)_ â€“ for solid Java implementation and internal working

Problem-solving is reinforced through:

- **Leetcode** â€“ for structured, topic-wise DSA problems
- **Codeforces** â€“ for logical reasoning, speed, and competitive programming strength (focusing on 800â€“1200 rated problems initially)
