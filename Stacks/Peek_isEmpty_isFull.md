Peek, isEmpty, isFull
The peek, isEmpty, and isFull are some other functions used in stacks.

peek - This function allows you to look at the element at the top of the stack. It's a way to inspect the next item that would be removed if a pop operation were to be performed.

For a stack: Peek would return the last item added (since stacks follow Last In, First Out order).
isEmpty - This function checks whether a data structure (like a stack, queue, list, etc.) contains any elements or not.

If the data structure contains no elements, isEmpty returns true.
If there is at least one element in the data structure, isEmpty returns false.
isFull - This function is typically relevant for a fixed size stack. It allows you to determine if the data structure has reached its maximum capacity.
